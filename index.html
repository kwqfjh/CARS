        <h2>Why Electric Cars Are Bad for the Environment</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Battery Production Pollution</h3>
        <p>Electric car batteries require <strong>lithium, cobalt, and nickel</strong>, mined in ways that <strong>damage ecosystems</strong>. Mining operations can <strong>pollute rivers</strong> and <strong>destroy habitats</strong>.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Energy Source Issues</h3>
        <p>Many electric cars are still charged using <strong>coal or gas-powered electricity</strong>. The carbon footprint of charging can sometimes <strong>match or exceed petrol car emissions</strong> over the vehicle’s lifetime.</p>
        
        <h3>3. End-of-Life Waste</h3>
        <p>Battery disposal is a growing problem. Old lithium-ion batteries are <strong>hard to recycle</strong> and can leak <strong>toxic chemicals</strong> into the environment.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Petrol Cars</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Lower Production Footprint</h3>
        <p>Petrol cars don’t require massive batteries. Producing a petrol car emits <strong>less pollution upfront</strong> compared to building an electric vehicle.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Fueling Infrastructure & Convenience</h3>
        <p>Petrol stations are <strong>everywhere</strong>, reducing energy losses from home charging and transport. Quick refueling reduces energy waste and keeps vehicles on the road longer.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Performance & Longevity</h3>
        <p>Petrol engines provide <strong>consistent performance</strong> and can last decades if maintained. Less dependence on <strong>rare metals</strong> means fewer environmental and ethical issues.</p>
